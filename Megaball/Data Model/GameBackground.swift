//  What the playfield is painted with, as data.
//
//  The scene has always known how to paint these, and until now that was the only place the
//  knowledge lived: three colours and a pair of gradient stops written inline in
//  `applyBackgroundSetting`. That was fine while the only thing that ever showed a background
//  was the game.
//
//  The selection screen shows all four at once, in miniature, and it has to show them
//  *correctly* - a picker whose Gradient is a different gradient from the one you get when you
//  play is worse than a picker that only lists names. So the definitions move here, and both
//  the scene and the mock-up read them from the same place.
