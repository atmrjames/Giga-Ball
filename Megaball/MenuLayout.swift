//
//  MenuLayout.swift
//  Megaball
//
//  Keeps the menu screens to a readable column on large screens.
//
//  The menus were built at a fixed 414x736 and centred, which is why they survived iPad
//  at all. Once that fixed size was removed so they could use the whole of an iPhone,
//  they filled an iPad too - full-width rows on an 11-inch screen, which is a lot of
//  nothing between an icon and its label.
//
//  Rather than constrain each screen's contents, this insets the safe area the contents
//  are already pinned to. Every menu lays its title, table and close button out against
//  the container's safe area guide, so insetting it moves all of them at once - and the
//  container itself, which carries the blurred backdrop, still fills the screen.
//

    /// twelve menu screens share a nib and a navigation pattern but not a layout - each is
